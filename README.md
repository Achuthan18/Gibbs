# Gibbs.
A demonstration of Gibbs phenomenon using Fourier Series and Sawtooth Wave.

For a periodic signal with discontinuities, if the signal is reconstructed by adding the Fourier series, then overshoots appear around the edges. These overshoots decay outwards in a damped oscillatory manner away from the edges. This is known as GIBBS phenomenon and is shown in the plots provided
